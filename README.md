## Final Comments

The project was setup to learn how to use Ruby on Rails and so the best practices for my html and styling weren't followed. I was purely focused on learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails. If I decide to grow this application these would be improved along with the future implimentations listed. Have fun trying it out and feel free to use the code however you like!
